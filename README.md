# Stats Tracker for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare

This application uses a RapidAPI call to retrieve the Warzone player stats for a given gamertag.

It shows team placement, which can be used to count the number of wins a player has in the game. This data can be used to create a "Win Counter" such as: [Modern Warzone Counter](https://github.com/modern-hobbyist/modern-warzone-counter)
